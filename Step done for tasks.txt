 5. If you like, share your experience in completing this challenge, good and/or bad. 

	I done the task once after a number of trip ups and completed the tasks requested,
	I had no issues doing the assignment but felt I still had no comprehension of what 
	actually happened or how i got	 there, I decided to also do the task again noting 
	down the steps for both a GUI (lazy/efficient at times approach) and also a more 
	terminal approach
